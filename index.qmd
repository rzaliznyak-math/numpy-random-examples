# Introduction: Stop Taking People's Word for It


Building on our previous article [The Power of Data Simulation](https://rzaliznyak-math.github.io/random/){target="_blank"}, here we delve deeper into the practical applications of NumPy's random number generation for AB Testing. 

You'll learn to simulate null distributions and understand p-values, crucial concepts in statistical analysis. We'll demonstrate how to generate millions of AB test time-series simulations in seconds. Additionally, we'll explore the visualization of statistical power, enhancing your intuition about sample sizes and effect magnitudes.

By the end of this article, you'll have a richer toolkit for conducting sophisticated AB tests using NumPy's powerful random functions, enabling more insightful and efficient statistical modeling in your work.
