# Expand Your Toolkit

The goal of this paper is to continue to build on our last paper, [The Power of Data Simulation](https://rzaliznyak-math.github.io/random/){target="_blank"}.

By the end of this paper you will be able to simulate distributions and understand p-values, crucial concepts in AB Testing.
You'll learn how to generate millions of time-series simulations for A/B tests in just seconds. You'll discover how to visualize statistical power, enhancing your intuition for sample sizes and effect size magnitudes.

You'll have a deeper toolkit for conducting AB tests using NumPy's powerful random functions, enabling more insightful statistical modeling in your work.
